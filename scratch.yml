# Buen Timer ejemplo

ust looking at your code without the means of testing it I can see anything wrong.
Have you tried adapting the example code from the cookbook to see if the results are the same?
Quick cut and paste with your variables inserted should probably work.

automation:
  alias: Turn on bedroom lights when there is movement
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.bedroom_motion
      to: 'yes'
  action:
    service: homeassistant.turn_on
    entity_id: script.timed_lamp

script:
  timed_lamp:
    alias: "Turn on lamp and set timer"
    sequence:
      # Cancel ev. old timers
      - execute_service: script.turn_off
        service_data:
           entity_id: script.timer_off
      - execute_service: light.turn_on
        service_data:
          entity_id: light.bedroom
      # Set new timer
      - execute_service: script.turn_on
        service_data:
          entity_id: script.timer_off

  timer_off:
    alias: "Turn off lamp after 30 minutes"
    sequence:
      - delay:
          minutes: 30
      - execute_service: light.turn_off
        service_data:
          entity_id: light.bedroom
